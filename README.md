# Coin Flipper

This is a program I wrote while taking AP Computer Science A during my sophomore year of high school. The program prints the outcome of flipping a coin with the number of flips determined by user-input. After flipping, a method called *generateStats* prints stats about the flipping, such as the total number of heads and tails and longest streaks of heads and tails. I wrote this program because I was interested in finding what the longest streak of either heads or tails could be after 1,000, 10,000, or 1,000,000 flips. 

### Sample Output
```

You flipped 10 coins. Here's the stats of those flips:
Heads was flipped 5 times.
Tails was flipped 5 times.
The longest number of heads in a row was: 3
The longest number of tails in a row was: 2
